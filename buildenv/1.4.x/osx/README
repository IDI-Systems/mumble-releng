To build an up-to-date Mumble build environment on OS X, do the following:

1. Ensure you have a /MumbleBuild directory that's writable by your user.
   If not, do the following to get one:

      sudo mkdir -p /MumbleBuild
      sudo chown $USER:admin /MumbleBuild

2. Run ./setup.command to install the build environment.
   On success, you should be told under what name the build
   environment was installed. Copy the name.

3. Open a new Terminal window.

4. Execute the following to enter the build environment:

       source /MumbleBuild/osx-1.3.x-2014-05-294bfbe10/env

   (Replacing the path above with the one you copied in
    step #2.)

5. cd ${MUMBLE_PREFIX}/mumble-releng

6. Execute:

       ./build-all.bash

   This will fetch and build all libraries and tools needed to build Mumble
   from scratch on OS X.  Enjoy!

7. Once it's done building, you can open Terminals in the future and
   simply do:

   source /Mumble/osx-1.3.x-(...)/env

   To source your build env, and build Mumble inside it!
